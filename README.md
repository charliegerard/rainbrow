## Tech stack

* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JavaScript with the [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) framework for facial expression detection

## Commands

The original iOS game works with detecting the brows but the face-api framework works with expression detection so it's a little different:

* Frowning (sad) <-> Move down
* Looking surprised <-> Move up
* Neutral <-> Stay in place
